To generate hfile, run

  cksum sonnets/* > hfile

The "base sonnet" must be the first line on the command line, which works here because sonnets/base is the base sonnet and the other sonnets are called sonnets/sXX where XX are digits.

To run the testsuite, run

  ./test.sh

If the tests are successful, testsuite will print out 30 lines of the same repeated test hash, followed by "OK; 30 tests passed."
