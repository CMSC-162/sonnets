Professor Kurtz is full of wisdom deep 
His words are full of wit but never venom 
In class we quick from fact to insight leap 
He sports a shock of white and shirts of denim
When facing awful syntax born of awk 
Professor Kurtz assures us it ain't tricky 
And when we want to help each other grok 
We know that we can always search the wiki
And when we ply the trade of C and GNU 
Removed by years from UChicago's College 
We'll think back to our dear 162 
That put us on the trailhead of knowledge
And all our skills with sed and C's asserts 
Will owe a debt to dear Professor Kurtz
