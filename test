Professor Kurtz is full of wisdom deep 
His talks are full of wit but never venom 
In class we quick from code to insight leap 
He sports a shock of white and smocks of denim
When facing awful braces born of awk 
Professor Kurtz assures us it's not tricky 
And when we wish to help each other grok 
We know that we can always search our wiki
And when we ply the trade of Linux/GNU 
Removed by years from UChicago's College 
We'll yearn back to our dear 161 
That put us on the way to newer knowledge
And all our skills with sed and C's asserts 
Will owe a debt to dear Professor Kurtz
